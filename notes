## to do
pseudo-code:

~~set up input parameters~~  
~~set up output directories~~  
~~read metadata~~  
~~read images for nucleus, FISH, IF~~  
~~identify and filter for nucleus~~  
identify FISH spot within a given nucleus  
generate random spots in same nucleus    
~~measure IF intensity - support multiple IF channels~~  
output standard excel files  
output images of called FISH foci with IF channels  
output 2D contour graphs  
output 3D contour graphs  

## improvements
Better nuclear distinction. Like for touching nuclei.  
Maybe have separate function to quickly test different thresholds to see what works?  
Right now, we use the middle 50% of the z stacks as "valid nuclei". We could improve this, but would have to re-think
how we call nuclear pixels
@Improvement Could probably just choose x random spots and calculate mean/std from that. Maybe faster and more
    # memory efficient
